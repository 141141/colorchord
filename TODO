Still to do:

Try this:
* Make Linear keep the order of the notes in-order.

* For light finding, pick lights off the peaks to get number of lights to use.
* For light shifting (for 1d-looping light systems) shift the centers of the notes, then vernoi between the notes.

Brenden:
* Consider running DFT on all channels and mixing results
